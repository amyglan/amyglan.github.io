      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;background&#34;&gt;Background&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since, this essay will be about me therefore it will involve the usage of the word &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rdquo; (which I despise) a lot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was in the initial few months of my junior year at BITS Pilani when I came across the word &amp;ldquo;startup&amp;rdquo;. I was immediately hooked because of the success stories of BITSian Alumni who have gone on to build successful startups and earned fortunes. So I started searching for the ways to earn money through internet. Only thing I knew at the time was &amp;ldquo;Physics/Mathematics/Chemistry&amp;rdquo; because of the JEE Advanced exam (which I had cleared with pretty good rank), I thought that I can earn money teaching the upcoming batches these subjects and so I did that.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
